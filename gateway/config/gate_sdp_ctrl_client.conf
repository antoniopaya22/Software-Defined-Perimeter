#USE_SPA                         Y



# Path to fwknop client program for sending SPA to controller
# gateway. Default is 'fwknop', meaning the system default will
# be used.
#
#FWKNOP_PATH                     /path/to/fwknop



# Name of stanza in fwknoprc file with options to send SPA to 
# controller gateway.

# is no.

# If set to 'N', the client will daemonize and run in the 
# background. Default is yes.
#
FOREGROUND                      Y


# Set to 'Y' to write to syslog facility even when running
# in foreground. Syslog is used automatically when running
# the client as a daemon. If running the client in the 
# foreground, this defaults to no.
#
#USE_SYSLOG			Y


# A number indicating what priority level messages to print
# and/or log. This accepts a range of zero to 7. The default 
# is 5 = LOG_NOTICE. The levels are as follows:
# LOG_EMERG	0
# LOG_ALERT	1
# LOG_CRIT	2
# LOG_ERR	3
# LOG_WARNING	4
# LOG_NOTICE	5
# LOG_INFO	6
# LOG_DEBUG	7

# Delay in seconds after sending SPA packet, before attempting
# to make the socket connection to the controller. This allows the
# gateway protecting the controller time to receive the SPA packet,
# process it, and open the appropriate firewall port before the SDP
# control client attempts to connect to the controller. This field
# accepts floating point arguments down to the nanosecond. The 
# range is 0 to 10 seconds, but if the field is set to zero or not
# set, it defaults to 0.5 seconds.

# Socket write timeout in seconds. Default is 1.

#WRITE_TIMEOUT                   1



# Seconds to wait between successful requests to update credentials.
# This is not to be confused with the failed request retry interval
# described below. A credential update includes the client's HMAC
# and encryption keys for sending SPA packets, as well as an
# encryption key and client certificate for secure, encrypted
# connections to the SDP network. Default is 7200.
# 
#CREDENTIAL_UPDATE_INTERVAL      7200



# Seconds to wait between successful requests to update service info.

# Seconds to wait between successful requests to update credentials.
# This is not to be confused with the failed request retry interval
# described below. Default is 86400.
# 
#ACCESS_UPDATE_INTERVAL          7200



# Maximum number of attempts to connect to the Controller before 
# the client declares failure and exits. Default is 3. This can
# be set to 0 (zero) meaning to continue trying indefinitely.
#
#MAX_CONN_ATTEMPTS               3



# Seconds to wait if a first connection attempt fails. This interval
# automatically doubles with successive failures. Range is 1 to 7200.
# Default is 5.
#
#INITIAL_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL     5



# Seconds to wait between keep alive requests if the client is
# configured to remain connected. These requests are at the 
# application layer and in addition to the socket layer keep alive
# mechanism. Default is 10.
# 
KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL             1800



# Maximum number of successive failed requests before the client
# declares failure and exits. Default is 3.
#
#MAX_REQUEST_ATTEMPTS            3



# Seconds to wait if a first request attempt fails. This interval
# automatically doubles with successive failures. This is used
# for requests such as credential update, keep alive, etc. Range 
# is 1 to 7200. Default is 5.
